#web navigatiuon :
 In React, we usually handle navigation using a library like React Router.

#ðŸš€ How React Navigation Works (React Router)
When you use React Router:

<Routes> and <Route> define which component (page) shows up for each URL path.

useNavigate() is a hook used to move (navigate) between pages programmatically (like after login).

<Link> is a component used to add clickable links to navigate between pages without reloading.

#ðŸ§­ Example from Your App:

<Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
<Route path="/userHome" element={<UserHome />} />
